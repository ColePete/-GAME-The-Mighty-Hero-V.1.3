# [GAME] The Mighty Hero 


**Directions**
In this game, you will go against different monsters and defeat them to save your village. Can you figure out how to do it and survive? To choose an action, just type in the corresponding number and click enter.


**Weapon Selection Information**
FYI when you choose a weapon, the sword increases attack by 4 but decreases the heal by 3. On the other hand, the bow and arrow decreases your attack by 2 , but boosts your heal by 5.
